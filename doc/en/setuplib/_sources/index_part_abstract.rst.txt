Abstract
********

Modern landscapes of information infrastructures are commonly designed 
and organized as stacks of runtime service environments.
The technical architecture of the service stacks consists of a wide range of
heterogenous landscapes of components frequently requiring 
adaptation and mediation - resulting in a landscape of apps for the 
creation and installation of developer and user documentation.

The package *setuplib* provides utilities for the display of detailed information
on Python software packages and the contained entry points.
